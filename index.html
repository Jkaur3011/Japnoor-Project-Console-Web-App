    <h3> NOW LET'S KNOW HOW TO PRINT CONSOLE</h3>
<p> Now tell me what is 10,000 + 9900, it's tough right. Now check in console, you have the answer. 
    <script>
        var n1 = "10000";
        var n2 = "9900";
        var add = n1 + n2 ;
        console.log(add);
    </script>
    You have answer right. See how I did this: <br>
    I created 2 variables: <br>
    var n1 = "10000"; <br>
    var n2 = "9900"; <br>
    Then I created last variable : <br>
    var add = n1 + n2 <br>
    Now to print answer use: <br>
    console.log(add); <br> 
    Don't forget to put semi-colons in end.. <br>
